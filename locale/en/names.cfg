vs-helping-book-1=Engineer's pocket might contain anything imaginable! This mod has a special recipe called "Check pockets", it gives you vanilla ores directly out of the void with a certain chance. Also, after you unlock Assembly Machine you could use "Check pockets" that gives you even some crude oil.\n(Now after you read this you can burn this note to release some free stuff)
vs-helping-book-2=Void Catalyst is a mysterious substance that can be obtained in various ways. It mostly serves as an ingredient for ore duplication and as a fuel for Void Electrical Generators and Void Furnaces. You can obtain it in four ways:\n- it is given with certain chance when character crafts something using inventory (configurable);\n- it can be indirectly processed out of Void Stone;\n- it could be slowly collected out of thin air\n- finally, it will slowly appear when you insert Void Stone into Snatch Chest inventory.\n(Now after you read this you can burn this note to release some free stuff)
vs-helping-book-3=As it comes from the name, it is a chest. It has large inventory (configurable) but most valuable is that inventory is shared between all Snatch Chests along the world, no matter how much you built. Also, it will generate Void Catalyst when you place Void Stone inside.\n(Now after you read this you can burn this note to release some free stuff)
vs-helping-book-4=This mod has a recipe for duplicating all raw vanilla resources: coal, iron, copper, stone and even wood - everything can be duplicated following simple rule: give some ore, add a Void Catalyst and take a slightly more ore as a result. Yes, this is cheat, but you knew what kind of mod you downloaded)\n(Now after you read this you can burn this note to release some free stuff)
vs-helping-book-5=This mod has 6 special chests, they called Hungry for a reason: when you put some Void Catalyst inside one of them, it will start slowly consume it. As a result it will create raw resources and plece them inside making your interaction profitable for both sides. Just like Snatch Chest, Hungry Chests of same color have same inventory.\n(Now after you read this you can burn this note to release some free stuff)

vs-hungry-chest-a=All Hungry Chests of the same color share inventory among the world. Smelt to obtain next color. Consumes Void Catalyst and creates raw ores inside
vs-hungry-chest-b=All Hungry Chests of the same color share inventory among the world. Smelt to obtain next color. Consumes Void Catalyst and creates raw ores inside
vs-hungry-chest-c=All Hungry Chests of the same color share inventory among the world. Smelt to obtain next color. Consumes Void Catalyst and creates raw ores inside
vs-hungry-chest-d=All Hungry Chests of the same color share inventory among the world. Smelt to obtain next color. Consumes Void Catalyst and creates raw ores inside
vs-hungry-chest-e=All Hungry Chests of the same color share inventory among the world. Smelt to obtain next color. Consumes Void Catalyst and creates raw ores inside
vs-hungry-chest-f=All Hungry Chests of the same color share inventory among the world. Smelt to obtain next color. Consumes Void Catalyst and creates raw ores inside

vs-snatch-chest=A handy chest that shares its inventory among other same chests all over the map. Inventory size is configurable through mod settings. Contents is safe even when last copy of the chest is destroyed. Generates Void Catalyst when Void Stone is present inside
vs-used-void-nugget=A tiny piece of Void Stone that already done its job. Combine 100 of these to obtain a new Void Stone
vs-void-catalyst=Given with a certain chance when character crafts something in inventory. Versatile substance used for ore duplication and fueling Void Generator
vs-void-furnace=Special furnace fuiled with Void Catalyst. It can multiply ores and wood
vs-void-generator=Low-power Generator that takes Void Catalyst as a fuel and gives humble current. Roughly enought to supply two assembling machines. This ain't much, but it's honest work
vs-void-nugget=A tiny piece of Void Stone. Used to get Void Catalyst
vs-void-shard=A small piece of Void Stone. Can be split into Void Nuggets
vs-void-stone=A unique artifact containing an essence of the void magic. Can be split into Void Shards
