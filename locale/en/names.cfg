[item-description]
vs-void-catalyst=Given roughly each second time you craft something in your inventory. Versatile substance used for ore duplication, fueling Void Generator and making Snatch Chests
vs-void-generator=Low-power Generator that takes Void Catalyst as a fuel and gives humble current to supply roughly two assembling machines. This is ain't much, but it's honest work
vs-snatch-chest=A handy chest that shares its inventory among other same chests all over the map. Contents is safe even when last copy of the chest is destroyed. Also generates one Void Catalyst inside each ten seconds, not more than one stack

vs-helping-book-1=In the Engineer's pocket, there's everything imaginable! Try digging around in there thoroughly, perhaps you'll manage to find something that will help you at the start? There are two versions of the Void Snatch recipe: with Crude Oil and without it. One you can use in your inventory right away, but to obtain void resources along with oil, you'll need to unlock the Level 2 Assembly Machine. (You can burn this note to release the magic contained within)
vs-helping-book-2=This substance is added to your inventory with a 50% chance every time you create something. It serves as fuel for the Void Generator and, as the name suggests, contributes to more advantageous ore duplication recipes (You can burn this note to release the magic contained within)
vs-helping-book-3=This mod adds recipes for ore duplication. All of them follow a simple rule: you must give something as input yo get a bit more as output. Where this "bit more" comes from - the answer lies behind the veil of mystery (You can burn this note to release the magic contained within)
vs-helping-book-4= This is very convenient item for those who don't want to build complex logistic chains but want things to somehow take care of themselves. All chests you place on the map share a common inventory. You can restrict number of slots available for automation, as you would do it with ordinary chest, and set an item filter for each slot by using the mouse wheel click. Additionally, once every 10 seconds, a new bottle of Void Catalyst appears in it, but no more than one stack so do not forget to take it from time to time (You can burn this note to release the magic contained within)
