[item-description]
vs-helping-book-1=In the Engineer's pocket, there's everything imaginable! Try digging around in there thoroughly, perhaps you'll manage to find something that will help you at the start? There are two versions of the Void Snatch recipe: onc that includes Crude Oil and one that does not. You can use "dry" one in your inventory right away, but to obtain void resources along with crude oil, you'll need to unlock the Level 2 Assembly Machine. (You can burn this note to release the magic contained within)
vs-helping-book-2=This substance has a 20% chance (configurable) of being added to your inventory each time you craft an item. It serves as fuel for the Void Generator and, as the name suggests, contributes to more advantageous ore duplication (You can burn this note to release the magic contained within)
vs-helping-book-3=This mod adds recipes for ore duplication. All of them follow a simple rule: you must give something as input to get a bit more as output. Where this "bit more" comes from - the answer lies behind the veil of mystery (You can burn this note to release the magic contained within)
vs-helping-book-4=This is very convenient item for those who don't want to build complex logistic chains but want things to somehow take care of themselves. All chests you place on the map share a common inventory. You can restrict the number of slots available for automation, as you would with an ordinary chest, and set an item filter for each slot by using the mouse wheel click. Additionally, once every 10 seconds, a new bottle of Void Catalyst appears inside if void Stone present. (You can burn this note to release the magic contained within)
vs-helping-book-5=A special furnace that can extract the essence of void from excess raw ore and turn it into Void Catalyst. Output rates per 5 ore units: Coal/Stone - 1 catalyst, Iron/Copper - 2 catalysts, Uranium - 4 catalysts, Wood - 1 catalyst

vs-hungry-chest-a=Each second tries to consume Void Catalyst from internal inventory giving basic ores as reward with certain chance. All Hungry Chests of the same color share inventory among the map
vs-hungry-chest-b=Each second tries to consume Void Catalyst from internal inventory giving basic ores as reward with certain chance. All Hungry Chests of the same color share inventory among the map
vs-hungry-chest-c=Each second tries to consume Void Catalyst from internal inventory giving basic ores as reward with certain chance. All Hungry Chests of the same color share inventory among the map
vs-hungry-chest-d=Each second tries to consume Void Catalyst from internal inventory giving basic ores as reward with certain chance. All Hungry Chests of the same color share inventory among the map
vs-hungry-chest-e=Each second tries to consume Void Catalyst from internal inventory giving basic ores as reward with certain chance. All Hungry Chests of the same color share inventory among the map
vs-hungry-chest-f=Each second tries to consume Void Catalyst from internal inventory giving basic ores as reward with certain chance. All Hungry Chests of the same color share inventory among the map

vs-snatch-chest=A handy chest that shares its inventory among other same chests all over the map. Inventory size is configurable through mod settings. Contents is safe even when last copy of the chest is destroyed. Also generates one Void Catalyst inside each ten seconds if Void Stone is present inside. Once the Void Catalyst count exceeds one stack, generation pauses (this behavour is controlled through mod settings)
vs-used-void-nugget=A tiny piece of Void Stone that done its job well. Combine 100 of these to obtain a new Void Stone
vs-void-catalyst=Given with 20% chance each time you craft something in your inventory (the chance is configurable through mod settings). Versatile substance used for ore duplication, fueling Void Generator and making Snatch Chests
vs-void-furnace=Special furnace that can turn your raw ore excesses into the Void Catalyst. Output rates depend on input ore rarity
vs-void-generator=Low-power Generator that takes Void Catalyst as a fuel and gives humble current (configurable through mod settings) to supply roughly two assembling machines. This ain't much, but it's honest work
vs-void-nugget=A tiny piece of Void Stone used for Void Catalyst production. Produces Weakened Void Nuggets after being used
vs-void-shard=A small piece of Void Stone used for void ores generation. Produces Weakened Void Nuggets after being used
vs-void-stone=A unique artifact containing an essence of the void magic. Use wisely and carefully, you won't get a second one
